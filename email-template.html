      <p>Our under 10 girls play their last game at home under lights on <strong>Friday 8 August at 6.15pm</strong> and you‚Äôre welcome to come to see what it‚Äôs all about. The rules are modified for the enjoyment and safety of the girls and they love every minute of it.</p>

      <p>Albion Football Club is incredibly proud of our growing Junior Girls Football Program, dedicated to providing a fun, safe, inclusive environment for our footballers to be the best version of themselves. We are the only football club in the region to provide these opportunities to girls and we‚Äôre excited by the prospect of fielding 4 girls teams in 2026 for the very first time, including under 10s, under 12s, under 14s and under 16s.</p>

      <p>Later in the year, Harlow will also receive an invite to participate in our free Girls Football Summer Development Program. Last year our girls were lucky enough to receive coaching from some of the best AFLW players in the game, including 2024 North Melbourne Premiership Captain and 6-time All Australian <strong>Emma Kearney</strong>, along with her Premiership teammate <strong>Kate Shierlaw</strong>.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions or want to get involved, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. We‚Äôre always happy to help!</p>
